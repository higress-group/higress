title: External Authentication
keywords: [higress, auth]
description: The Ext Authentication plugin implements the capability to call external authorization services for authentication and authorization.
---

## Feature Description

The `ext-auth` plugin sends an authorization request to an external authorization service to check if the client request is authorized. When implementing this plugin, it refers to the native [ext_authz filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter) of Envoy, and realizes part of the capabilities of the native filter to connect to an HTTP service.

## Operating Attributes

Plugin Execution Phase: `Authentication Phase`
Plugin Execution Priority: `360`

### Differences between the two `endpoint_mode`

When `endpoint_mode` is `envoy`, the authentication request will use the original request's HTTP Method and the configured `path_prefix` as the request path prefix, concatenated with the original request path.

When `endpoint_mode` is `forward_auth`, the authentication request will use the configured `request_method` as the HTTP Method and the configured `path` as the request path. Higress will automatically generate and send the following headers to the authorization service:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `x-forwarded-proto` | The scheme of the original request, such as http/https |
| `x-forwarded-method` | The method of the original request, such as get/post/delete/patch |
| `x-forwarded-host` | The host of the original request |
| `x-forwarded-uri` | The path of the original request, including path parameters, e.g., `/v1/app?test=true` |

### Blacklist and Whitelist Modes

Supports blacklist and whitelist mode configuration. The default is the whitelist mode. If the whitelist is empty, all requests need to be verified. The matching domain supports wildcard domains such as `*.bar.com`, and the matching rule supports `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `contains`, `regex`.

**Whitelist Mode**

```yaml
# Configuration for the whitelist mode. Requests that match the whitelist rules do not need verification.
match_type: 'whitelist'
match_list:
  # Requests with the domain name api.example.com and a path prefixed with /public do not need verification.
  - match_rule_domain: 'api.example.com'
    match_rule_path: '/public'
    match_rule_type: 'prefix'
  # For the image resource server images.example.com, all GET requests do not need verification.
  - match_rule_domain: 'images.example.com'
    match_rule_method: ["GET"]
  # For all domains, HEAD requests with an exact path match of /health-check do not need verification.
  - match_rule_method: ["HEAD"]
    match_rule_path: '/health-check'
    match_rule_type: 'exact'
```

**Blacklist Mode**

```yaml
# Configuration for the blacklist mode. Requests that match the blacklist rules need verification.
match_type: 'blacklist'
match_list:
  # Requests with the domain name admin.example.com and a path prefixed with /sensitive need verification.
  - match_rule_domain: 'admin.example.com'
    match_rule_path: '/sensitive'
    match_rule_type: 'prefix'
  # For all domains, DELETE requests with an exact path match of /user need verification.
  - match_rule_method: ["DELETE"]
    match_rule_path: '/user'
    match_rule_type: 'exact'
  # For the domain legacy.example.com, all POST requests need verification.
  - match_rule_domain: 'legacy.example.com'
    match_rule_method: ["POST"]
```


## Configuration Examples

Assume that in Kubernetes, the `ext-auth` service has a `serviceName` of `ext-auth`, a port of `8090`, a path of `/auth`, and is in the `backend` namespace.

### When endpoint_mode is envoy

#### Example 1

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  endpoint_mode: envoy
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_port: 8090
    path_prefix: /auth
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service is successful**:

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 HTTP/1.1
Host: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: xxx
Content-Length: 0
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service fails**:

When the response from the `ext-auth` service is 5xx, the client will receive an HTTP response code of 403 and all the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service.

If the `ext-auth` service returns response headers of `x-auth-version: 1.0` and `x-auth-failed: true`, they will be passed to the client.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
x-auth-version: 1.0
x-auth-failed: true
date: Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:19:41 GMT
server: istio-envoy
content-length: 0
```

When the `ext-auth` service is inaccessible or the status code is 5xx, the client request will be rejected with the status code configured in `status_on_error`.

When the `ext-auth` service returns other HTTP status codes, the client request will be rejected with the returned status code. If `allowed_client_headers` is configured, the response headers with corresponding matching items will be added to the client's response.

#### Example 2

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
      - exact: x-auth-version
    headers_to_add:
      x-envoy-header: true
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
      - exact: x-user-id
      - exact: x-auth-version
  endpoint_mode: envoy
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_host: my-domain.local
    service_port: 8090
    path_prefix: /auth
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
Content-Length: 0
```

If the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service contain `x-user-id` and `x-auth-version`, these two headers will be included in the request when the gateway calls the upstream.

#### Example 3: Passing Route Name to Authorization Service

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
      - exact: x-auth-version
    allowed_properties:
      - path: [route_name]
        header: x-route-name
    headers_to_add:
      x-envoy-header: true
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
      - exact: x-user-id
      - exact: x-auth-version
  endpoint_mode: envoy
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_host: my-domain.local
    service_port: 8090
    path_prefix: /auth
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
Content-Length: 0
X-Route-Name: your-route-name
```

By configuring `allowed_properties`, you can map Envoy filter state properties like `route_name` to HTTP headers and send them to the authorization service, enabling the authorization service to make decisions based on routing information.

### When endpoint_mode is forward_auth

#### Example 1

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  endpoint_mode: forward_auth
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_port: 8090
    path: /auth
    request_method: POST
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx" -H "Host: foo.bar.com"
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service is successful**:

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Host: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Forwarded-Proto: HTTP
X-Forwarded-Host: foo.bar.com
X-Forwarded-Uri: /users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5
X-Forwarded-Method: GET
Content-Length: 0
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service fails**:

When the response from the `ext-auth` service is 5xx, the client will receive an HTTP response code of 403 and all the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service.

If the `ext-auth` service returns response headers of `x-auth-version: 1.0` and `x-auth-failed: true`, they will be passed to the client.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
x-auth-version: 1.0
x-auth-failed: true
date: Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:19:41 GMT
server: istio-envoy
content-length: 0
```

When the `ext-auth` service is inaccessible or the status code is 5xx, the client request will be rejected with the status code configured in `status_on_error`.

When the `ext-auth` service returns other HTTP status codes, the client request will be rejected with the returned status code. If `allowed_client_headers` is configured, the response headers with corresponding matching items will be added to the client's response.

#### Example 2

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
      - exact: x-auth-version
    headers_to_add:
      x-envoy-header: true
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
      - exact: x-user-id
      - exact: x-auth-version
  endpoint_mode: forward_auth
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_host: my-domain.local
    service_port: 8090
    path: /auth
    request_method: POST
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx" -H "X-Auth-Version: 1.0" -H "Host: foo.bar.com"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Forwarded-Proto: HTTP
X-Forwarded-Host: foo.bar.com
X-Forwarded-Uri: /users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5
X-Forwarded-Method: GET
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
Content-Length: 0
```

If the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service contain `x-user-id` and `x-auth-version`, these two headers will be included in the request when the gateway calls the upstream.

#### Example 3: Passing Route Name to Authorization Service

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
      - exact: x-auth-version
    allowed_properties:
      - path: [route_name]
        header: x-route-name
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
      - exact: x-mse-consumer
      - exact: x-ext-auth-user
  endpoint_mode: forward_auth
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_port: 8090
    path: /auth
    request_method: POST
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx" -H "X-Auth-Version: 1.0" -H "Host: foo.bar.com"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Forwarded-Proto: HTTP
X-Forwarded-Host: foo.bar.com
X-Forwarded-Uri: /users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5
X-Forwarded-Method: GET
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
X-Route-Name: your-route-name
Content-Length: 0
```

By configuring `allowed_properties`, you can map Envoy filter state properties like `route_name` to HTTP headers and send them to the authorization service, enabling the authorization service to make decisions based on routing information.
